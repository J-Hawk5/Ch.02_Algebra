HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Spencer E. Daves

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?




2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3=0.66666
2 // 3=0
3/2=1.5
3//2=1
Because floor division round the answer to the next lowest number




3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
It creates an error because the program is case sensitive so A is not the same as a, so a has no value.





4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle

area_of_rectangle because it fully describes the variable and uses lower case letters and underscores.



5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple               Not allowed
account number       Not allowed
account_number
account.number       Not allowed
accountNumber
account#             Not allowed
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable
great_big_variable
great.big.variable  Not allowed
2x                  Not allowed
x2x
total%              Not allowed
#left               Not allowed






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)

prediction:a=15

answer:<class 'float'>



7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area






8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42)
type(42.0)
type("C3PO")
type(True)







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
